This is the only balm that meets all 3 conditions, but scores 2nd place after Clinique's Take the Day Off Balm. Why? Because of 2 main factors. First you have to work at it to get the balm to melt into an oily texture, and sometimes its gets thick and hard to massage in before it finally changes texture. Second, while it seems affordable, the amount in the tube and the amount required makes this actually more expensive than Clinique's.

I do that once a day, as my nighttime routine. I was amazed how well this got all of my SPF, makeup, sebum off my face and how clean my face felt but not stripped. I found that by using this balm, my face didn't produce as much oil throughout the day since I was no longer stripping the moisture barrier with harsh cleansers. I seriously feel like an idiot for not double cleansing before! Since this balm is expensive, I also ordered the cheaper DHC cleansing oil from Amazon to compare the two. The DHC smells like rancid olive oil and left a thick film of oil on my face after. It just doesn't compare!

Most derms will tell you to wear heavy mineral sunscreen but then say to use a mild, lotion-like cleanse that does nothing to take it off. It is essential to remove mineral sunscreens with an oil or balm, and maybe follow up with a mild double cleanse. This one is perfect for that, with or without the double cleanse. I like that there is no offensive smell or added fragrance. I did notice the second tube seemed a little thicker then the first, but if you shake it and squeeze the tube, it’s fine. It smoothes on easily, and rinses clean with warm water. I don’t detect any film after at all. Finally, you don’t need much. but you also don’t have to feel like you’re rationing it because of the price. It is so affordable. I have also tried the Paula’s Choice cleansing balm, but it is much smaller and more than twice the price. I like that one, but don’t love it.

All Fresh products have high prices and small ingredient list so I do not find this one to be totally worth it, no matter how amazing it makes my skin feel. Maybe I will change my mind, we will see. \n",

On its own I don't feel it gets rid of all my excess oil, but its pretty gentle around the eyes when washing off makeup. I feel like this tube is quite awkward though as I often end up having more product come out than I need which seems like a bit of a waste. \n",

      "Sephora Collection Original Cleansing Face Wipes - Aloe Vera So bummed! These were the most amazing exfoliating wipes. They were one of a kind. They worked. Plain and simple. Yes exfoliation! Now they are called “gentle”. And they are pretty much the same as much cheaper brands...Really no exfoliation at all. What happened? Bring them back. I’m sad \n",

      "Hard Pass The original wipes were wayyyy better than the new formulated ones. These new ones are sticky, like many reviewers have mentioned before, and left my face with a gross sticky film over my skin. It's more heavily coconut scented than the old wipes, almost to a super artificial level. \n",

      "Sephora Collection Mini Cleansing Face Wipes Why did you change this? All the benefits of the previous version are gone. I loved the exfoliation and the feeling that my skin was truly clean of all makeup and ready for skin care. This new one leaves a weird feeling on my skin. This was one of my constant repurchases and now, boom, nada. \n",

      "Sephora Collection Original Cleansing Face Wipes - Aloe Vera They were dry i reactivated with micellar water no big but Not repurchasing they were watermelon ones \n",

      "Why did you change a great product?! It is a shame they changed the formula!! They could have counted on me purchasing at least* one monthly. Reading all of the reviews I am glad I am not the only one that has had a recent change of heart. I have been using the coconut cleansing wipes for well over 3 years...the formula was fantastic. Now they are thick, they feel soapy and the smell isn’t as “natural”. I am sad to say that I will be finding another brand of wipes for my face. :( Sephora if you ever decide to go back to the way they were it’d be great to know. \n",
